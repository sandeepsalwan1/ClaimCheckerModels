# PROJECT OVERVIEW

# Our .env variables

# CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE


# IMPORTANT
Do TTD (Test Driven Development). Write tests first, then the code, then run the tests and update the code until tests pass

follow Dave Farleyâ€™s recommendations regarding how to write tests, and in particular, unit tests. Essentially, you should make sure the tests test some sort of outcome or functionality, NOT any particular implementation.

# OTHER CONTEXT
- make sure to **ALWAYS** include comments in your code
- do not delete comments unless they aren't needed
